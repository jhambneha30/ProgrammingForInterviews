/*A3)The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...n terms
   The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. 0 and 1 are the starting numbers.
   Write a C program to print the numbers that do not appear in the Fibonacci series.
   
   input: Number of terms ðŸ‘Ž in Fibonacci sequence to be considered.  
   output: The numbers that are not in Fibonacci sequence. For
   example, if the user enters n=7, the values to be printed are: 4 6 7     [3]*/
